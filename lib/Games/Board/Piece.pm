=head1 NAME

Games::Board::Piece - a parent class for board game pieces

=head1 VERSION

version 1.012

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Games::Board;

  my $board = Games::Board->new;

  $board->add_space(
  	id   => 'go',
	dir  => { next => 'mediterranean', prev => 'boardwalk' },
	cost => undef
  );

  my $tophat = Games::Board::Piece->new(id => 'tophat')->move(to => 'go');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a base class for representing the pieces in a board game.  

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

This method constructs a new game piece and returns it.

=head2 id

This returns the piece's id.

=head2 board

This returns the board object to which the piece is related.

=head2 current_space_id

This returns the id of the space on which the piece currently rests, if any.
It it's not on any space, it returns undef.

=head2 current_space

This returns the Space on which the piece currently rests, if any.  It it's not
on any space, it returns undef.

=head2 move

  $piece->move(dir => 'up')

  $piece->move(to  => $space)

This method moves the piece to a new space on the board.  If the method call is
in the first form, the piece is moved to the space in the given direction from
the piece's current space.  If the method call is in the second form, and
C<$space> is a Games::Board::Space object, the piece is moved to that space.
